&lt;p&gt;First of all, welcome everyone that made it this far and were enticed to click on this quite odd website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="about-the-content"&gt;About the content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this blog will only be short stories. Rather popular content you might be saying in front of your screen, but no no no my friend, there's a catch.
There will be a main theme, a compelling story, joyfull and sometimes joyless character (the not-so original formula), BUT there will be a lot of hasardeous turn of event as most of the situations our character will end up in will be resolved using dice roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a little example :
&lt;em&gt;As our fellow group of adventurer pushed the door of the tavern, all the faces were looking at them, and something fishy was going on.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A strange man came to them and asked a simple question:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one dice roll would happen here, in all honestly I would write the number given by the simple, yes quite beautiful die 20.
For the sake of demonstration, let's say I rolled a good old &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;.
Now the outcome of this unfortunate 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- We were all wondering how your young blood tasted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would turn the simple act of entering in a tavern into a desastrous face-to-face with vampires.
On the opposite side, everything would have been different if I would have rolled a 5, a 13 or even a 17. There will be a lot of possible outcome to each situation but you, the reader, will only see one each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try my best to upload content at least once a week on saturday, but keep an eye on the site or the rss feed (dicedrivenstories.com/rss.xml) as there might be some surprises during the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you'll have a really good time reading my short stories, and don't be afraid to send me some kind words at hainezob@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
